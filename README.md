# Memory Allocation Simulator

This project simulates memory allocation processes, such as allocation and deallocation, with a graphical user interface. It visualizes how memory is managed using algorithms like Worst-Fit, Best-Fit, or First-Fit.

## Features

- **Memory Allocation and Deallocation:** Simulate allocation of memory blocks.
- **Memory Visualization:** View the current state of memory usage graphically.
- **Interactive UI:** User-friendly Java Swing-based interface.
- **Algorithms:** Support for common memory allocation algorithms.
